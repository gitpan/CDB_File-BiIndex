This module requires DBFile, but that is standard with perl.  It also
requires MLDBM.  This can be retrieved from any CPAN mirror site.

To build and install the library by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install

*************************************************************
Please make sure that you have CDB_File version 0.86 or later
*************************************************************

Please note, that CDB_File version 0.83 declares its self to have a
version number 0.9.  Since that version has a bug, I have put a check
for that version number and CDB_File will die.

N.B. in order to install CDB_File using the CPAN module you have to
use the name

	TIMPX/CDB_File-0.86.tar.gz

rather than just asking for CDB_File.  Hopefully this will be fixed by
the time you read this.
